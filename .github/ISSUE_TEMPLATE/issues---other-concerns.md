**How to make a bug**

Test if the problem happens only with a particular source file or source file type, if so then upload a sample file. If you cannot upload the file then please install the application [MediaInfo.NET](https://github.com/stax76/MediaInfo.NET) and post media info about the source file.

If the issue happens only under special conditions then please describe how this conditions can be reproduced.

If there is a error message than copy the message if possible, if not then make a screenshot. Ater that search for the log file because it should not only contain the error message but also additional useful debug information. The log file is located in the temp folder and the temp folder is located in the same directory as the source file. The log file ends with _staxrip.log. Visit the wesite pastebin.com and paste the log file content there, use the auto expire feature and set it to one year.
